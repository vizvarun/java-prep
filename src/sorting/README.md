# Java and DSA Learning Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to learning Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) from scratch, with a focus on solving medium-level problems on LeetCode. The goal is to build a strong foundation in Java programming and algorithmic thinking.

## Learning Path

We are following a structured learning path outlined in the Notion sheet available [here](https://www.notion.so/vizvarun/JAVA-PREP-FROM-SCRATCH-TO-LEETCODE-MED-1ab2350141ee809b80e6e2598ba473f5?pvs=4). This resource provides a comprehensive guide to mastering Java and DSA concepts.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders:

- `src`: The folder to maintain source code for various topics and problems.
- `lib`: The folder to maintain dependencies.
- `bin`: The folder where compiled output files will be generated.

## Setup Instructions

To run the Java code using the Java Extension Runner in Visual Studio Code, ensure that you have the following source paths added in your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
"java.project.sourcePaths": [
"src/classes-and-objects",
"src/control-flow",
"src/dynamic-programming-basics",
"src/graphs",
"src/hashing-and-maps",
"src/java-basics",
"src/leetcode-problems",
"src/list-and-array-operations",
"src/methods-and-functions",
"src/oop-principles",
"src/priority-queue",
"src/recursion-and-backtracking",
